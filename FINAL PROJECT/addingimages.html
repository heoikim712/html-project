            <h1><strong><u>Adding Images=</u></strong></h1>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                Your website would look extremely boring without any images. Imagine if <a href="https://amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon</a> had no images! If that was true, you wouldn't see any images of <br> the products you are willing to purchase. That would be <em>terrible</em>! In this lesson, I'll teach you guys how to add Images into your websites to make <br> them more interesting and interactive.

            <h2><strong><u>Steps=</u></strong></h2>
            <h3><strong>Use <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> Element=</strong></h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                First, add the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag and you'll see that <abbr title="Visual Studio Code">VSC</abbr> will automaticly add the source and alternate attributes for you. In the source attribute, you have to <br> add the relative link or an absolute link of the image you would like to add. Then, in the <abbr title="Alternate">alt</abbr> attribute, you'll need to type a short sentences (few words) <br> that will apear just in case if there's a problem in the process of loading the image. This way, even if the image doesn't load, the audience will have <br> an idea of what the image is about. Next, I'll show you guys other attributes that you can add to your <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag.
            </p>
            <dl style="font-size: 20px;">
                <dt><strong>Title Attribute=</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                    Another attribute you can add is the <strong>title attribute</strong>. Whatever text you add for the value of the attribute will apear if the user puts their cursor <br> on top of the image. 
                </dd>

                <dt><br><strong>Width and Height Attribute=</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                    As the name suggests, this attribute is used to modify the dimention of the image. The width modifies the width, and the heiht modifies the height. <br> When you see the dimention of and image, you'll see something like this, 200 x 400. The first digit (200) signifies the width and the second digit <br> (400) tells you the height. However, modifying your image's dimention with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> is more recomended, however, doing it with just <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is just <br> as fine with CSS.
                </dd>

            <h2><strong><u>Example=</u></strong></h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                Here, I'll show you guys an example of an <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> code that'll apear as an image in your website.
            </p>

            <img src="img/imgCodeExample.png" alt="Image Code Example" title="Image Code Example">

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                In the example, you can see that I added all the attributes that I've mentioned before. I used the <abbr title="Source">src</abbr>, <abbr title="Alternate">alt</abbr>, title, width, and height attributes.

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                That'll be it for today's lesson. I have explained all the steps for adding an image to your website and all the attributes for the <abbr title="Image"><code>&lt;img&gt;</code></abbr> tag. Don't <br> forget to write down some code to put this lesson into practice and happy codin' for ya'll!
