        <h2><strong><u>WHY I CREATED THIS</u></strong></h2>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; width: 60%;" align="left" >
            This is why I created this <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>5 file. After I finished learning all the really basics of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, I wanted to have something left to show my coding skills and also wanted to review all the things I've learned from the past month and a quarter. Oh, and I forgot to mention that it took me 2 months to learn all the basics of HTML. I'm pretty happy about the results of this project and had a lot of fun writing all of this code. The project dificulty seemed nicely balanced, not to hard or easy. Another fun aspect is that I was pretending to be a teacher that created a website for his students to teach them how to code in HTML. And yeah, that was the whole purpose of the creation of this small little project. Now I just need to learn <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr>, <abbr title="Javascript">JS</abbr>, and Frameworks. I really hope that these topics would be understandable for me in the future because I really want to get a job as a beginner web dev as soon as I graduate highschool, and have the ability to purchase all the things that I like. Things like, watches, food, some clothing, and a 700~800 dollarish gaming PC that can also be used as my work <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr>. And yeah, that was pretty much the reason behind why I am learning Web Development, plus, I had the luxury of having an education in a private english school until junior high. <br>
